# Online Examination System

This project is an Online Examination System developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend and Java with Spring Boot for the backend. The system provides an interface for users to attempt multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and coding questions.

## Features
- **MCQ-based Examinations:** Users can attempt multiple-choice questions with immediate result display.
- **Coding Questions:** Support for writing and submitting code solutions with basic evaluation (not fully integrated due to time constraints).
- **Separate Frontend and Backend:** The project components (frontend and backend) are separate and require integration for a complete system.
- **API Development with Spring Boot:** Backend APIs developed using Java with Spring Boot.
- **API Testing with Postman:** Used Postman to test and interact with the backend APIs.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:** Java with Spring Boot

## Installation and Usage
1. **Frontend Setup:**
   - Open the `frontend` directory.
   - Launch the frontend by opening the `index.html` file in a web browser.

2. **Backend Setup:**
   - Navigate to the `backend` directory.
   - Run the Spring Boot application.
   - Use Postman to interact with the backend APIs. Import the provided Postman collection to test the APIs.

**Note:** Due to time constraints, the frontend and backend are developed separately and need integration for full functionality.

## Project Structure
- `frontend/`: Contains the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for the frontend.
- `backend/`: Includes the Java Spring Boot backend code.

## Future Improvements
- Integration of frontend and backend components for a complete working system.
- Enhanced evaluation logic for coding questions.
- Improved UI/UX and additional features.

## Contributions
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to fork the repository, open issues, and submit pull requests.

## Acknowledgments
This project was developed as part of a competition and serves as a demonstration of frontend and backend development with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Java Spring Boot, with API testing done using Postman.
